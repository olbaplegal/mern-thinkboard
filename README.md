## MERN thinkboard

This project will cover the complete development of a web application, from back-end to front-end, including database and deployment.

The back-end will be built with Node.js, creating a robust API to handle business logic and authentication.

The front-end will use React to build a dynamic and responsive user interface that consumes the API.

MongoDB will serve as the database, providing flexible and performant data storage.

I'll put the link of the site below when i finish the project.
